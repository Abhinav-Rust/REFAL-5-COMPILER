# Implementation Plan — A Refal-5 Compiler Built to Turchin's Design

**Status: APPROVED 2026-08-05 — Phase 0 in progress**
Chief Architect: Abhinav Sharma · Chief Developer: agent

All seven decisions in section 7 were approved, with standing authority for the Chief
Developer to take judgement calls inside the approved direction.

---

## 1. The goal

A Classic Refal-5 compiler **written in Refal**, which **emits Refal**, **compiles its own
sources**, and roots out as many classes of bug as is mathematically possible before emitting.
Rust remains only as bootstrap and verification harness.

## 2. The architectural question, and the answer

> *Should we build it exactly as Turchin envisioned, or change it to maximise bug detection?*

**These are the same thing, and that is not a coincidence.**

In Turchin's architecture the optimiser and the verifier are one mechanism. Chapter 4 of the 1980
monograph defines compilation as *driving* a configuration into a **graph of states**, cleaning
it, and generalising it. Chapter 5 then reuses that same graph for **metasystem analysis** —
proving properties of the program. Code generation is a single subsection, §4.7 "Mapping on the
Computer."

So a conventional pipeline with a verifier bolted on at the end would be *both* less Turchin and
less capable. Building the graph of states gets us the analysis for free, because the analysis is
a query over the same structure.

Turchin also fixed the ceiling himself, in **§5.8, Theorem 5.1**:

> *There exists no algorithm which could transform any graph of states into an equivalent perfect
> graph.*

Proved by modelling formal arithmetic in Refal and reducing to Church's theorem. No compiler can
certify a program bug-free. Any project claiming otherwise is claiming to have refuted Church.

### The one deliberate addition

Turchin's machinery attacks the general, undecidable problem. It does not give cheap, always-
terminating checks — and Refal-5 culture historically treats *recognition impossible* (no
sentence matched) as ordinary runtime behaviour rather than a bug.

We add a **fast decidable tier** on top of his graph. This is an addition, not a deviation: it
consumes the graph Turchin defined, and it catches the single most common Refal runtime failure
before the program ever runs.

### Two-tier analysis

| | Tier 1 — Decidable | Tier 2 — Metasystem analysis |
|---|---|---|
| Source | our addition, over Turchin's graph | Turchin §5.5–5.7 |
| Cost | milliseconds, always on | expensive, opt-in, budgeted |
| Terminates | always | bounded by a whistle |
| Catches | recognition-impossible reachability, dead sentences, builtin domain errors, shape mismatch, macrodigit overflow, open-`e` complexity | program equivalence, safety properties, deep invariants |
| Analogue | rustc's exhaustive `match` + clippy | nothing in mainstream compilers |

**Both read the same graph of states.** Build Turchin's machine once; get both.

### Fidelity is preserved by a mode switch, not by weakening the checks

Strict checking will reject valid Classic Refal-5 programs. That conflicts with our conformance
goal, so it is resolved with severity levels rather than by changing the language:

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` | **spec violation only** — keeps `--classic` a pure Refal-5 conformance mode |
| deny-by-default lint | statically **proven** runtime failure |
| warn-by-default lint | **possible** failure under approximation |
| allow | opt-in pedantry (termination hints, complexity) |

`refal build --classic` accepts exactly what Turchin's Refal-5 accepts. `--strict` is the
rustc-grade experience. **The language is never modified.** Only diagnostics differ.

### The guarantee we will publish

> In `--strict` mode the compiler statically rejects every program in which a *recognition
> impossible*, a builtin domain error, or a dead sentence is reachable. It does not and cannot
> prove absence of logic errors or non-termination — see Turchin 1980, §5.8, Theorem 5.1.

Narrow, mechanically checkable, honest, and still a larger promise than any existing Refal
toolchain makes.

## 3. What changes from the current roadmap

| Current | Proposed | Why |
|---|---|---|
| M4 tree-walking interpreter | **Flat view-field rewriting machine** | Host recursion caps depth at 1024; `Rev` over 1,500 symbols already fails. A Refal-written compiler cannot run on it. |
| M5 `refal-core` = AST clone + pretty-printer | **Graph of states** (§4.2–4.6) | The current Core is isomorphic to the AST; nothing is lowered. It cannot carry a backend or an analysis. |
| M6 native backend, before self-hosting | **Deferred off the critical path** | Not needed for "compiler in Refal emitting Refal." Becomes §4.7 inside the graph architecture, after self-hosting. |
| M7 self-hosting last | **Moved ahead of native codegen** | Self-host on the machine; codegen after. Removes the largest chunk of work from the path to the goal. |
| Milestones 2 & 3 marked Complete | **Reset to Partial** | Refal-5 blocks do not parse; 8 confirmed conformance defects. Docs gate future work on these being true. |
| — | **Tier 1 + Tier 2 analysis** | The Chief Architect's bug-elimination goal, made concrete. |

Everything already built is retained. The Rust implementation becomes the **differential-testing
oracle**, permanently — exactly as `REFAL-FIRST-COMPLETION.md` already intends.

## 4. Phases

Effort is given in relative units, not calendar dates. Each phase ends at a **gate** that must
pass before the next begins.

### Phase 0 — Truth and foundations · effort S · IN PROGRESS

- [x] Conformance defects #6, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12 fixed (`641ffc0`); tests 83 -> 102
- [ ] #13 Refal-5 blocks — deferred into Phase 1, it touches every crate
- [ ] #7 builtin library — Phase 1
- [x] Nineteen Turchin primary sources indexed with a verifying fetch script (`6a2ae3a`)
- [x] README rewritten to carry the vision and the honest status
- [ ] `TURCHIN-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- [ ] `VERIFICATION-CONTRACT.md`
- [ ] Spec-traceable conformance corpus consolidated

- Fix the eight confirmed conformance defects (issues #6–#13).
- Build a **spec-traceable conformance corpus**: every fixture cites a § of the Refal-5 reference.
- Correct `FRONTEND-COVERAGE.md`, `SEMANTIC-AUDIT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md` to the real state.
- Write `docs/TURCHIN-ARCHITECTURE.md` — his graph-of-states model mapped onto our crates, every
  decision cited to a section.
- Write `docs/VERIFICATION-CONTRACT.md` — error classes, severity model, the published guarantee,
  bounded by Theorem 5.1.
- Reserve syntax for optional shape declarations (§2.3 Function Formats) so it cannot collide later.

**Gate:** conformance corpus green; no doc claims something the code does not do.

### Phase 1 — The Refal machine · effort L · CRITICAL PATH

Turchin Ch. 1–2. Replaces `refal-runtime`.

- **1a** Flat view-field rewriting machine. Explicit expression heap and work list; no host-stack
  recursion; the 1024-depth cap disappears rather than being raised.
- **1b** Compiled matching plan — Turchin's **projecting algorithm** (§2.2). Classify `e`-variables
  open vs closed at compile time; order deterministic bindings (literals, `s.`, brackets, closed
  `e.`) before open splits; generate candidates lazily. Removes the measured blowup
  (5 open `e`-vars over 60 symbols currently takes 9 s).
- **1c** Macrodigit model corrected to §1.2.2: bounded at 2³²−1, big numbers as *sequences*.
  Must land before arithmetic.
- **1d** Builtin library, in dependency order:
  1. **File I/O** — `Card`, `Open`, `Get`, `Put`, `Putout`. *Without these a Refal compiler cannot
     read a source file.* Hard gate on Phase 4.
  2. **Arithmetic** — `Add`, `Sub`, `Mul`, `Div`, `Divmod`, `Mod`, `Compare`, `Trunc`, and `Real`
     are implemented.
  3. **Buried data** — `Br`, `Dg`, `Cp`, `Rp`, `Dgall` are implemented with evaluator-owned stack state.
  4. `Lenw`, `First`, `Last`, `Upper`, `Lower`, `Arg`, and `Step` are implemented; `Mu` and `Time` have tested bootstrap-runtime support, and `Up`/`Dn` now have a tagged invertible subset for supported runtime values. The official Chapter 6 metacode contract remains open.
- **1e** Refal-5 blocks (`, arg : { block }`) end-to-end — issue #13.

**Gate:** tokenise a 50 KB source file in Refal, on this machine, in reasonable time and memory.
Recursion depth bounded only by RAM. Full conformance corpus green.

### Phase 2 — Graph of states · effort L

Turchin Ch. 3–4. Replaces `refal-core`.

- **2a** Driving — bounded ground execution, deterministic structural graph infrastructure, shape-aware symbolic execution for known prefixes with symbolic tails, and a deterministic Tier 1 graph-analysis report are implemented; complete Turchin configuration driving and graph construction (§4.2) remain open.
- **2b** Function-aware structural reachability cleanup is implemented; semantic clean graphs (§4.3) and compilation strategy (§4.4) remain open.
- **2c** SCC detection is implemented as graph infrastructure; the bounded symbolic driver now records repeated configurations, whistle events, and conservative generalized inputs. Driven residualization projects each whistle into an explicit deterministic generalized residual state carrying the whistle state, previous/repeated inputs, and computed LGG input. The new generalized path constructs a bounded graph transition surface: each LGG becomes a generated residual function, the symbolic entry is redirected to it, and semantic cleaning materializes generated-to-source call transitions. Full Turchin generalisation, whistle termination, and complete configuration coverage (§4.6; 1988 *Algorithm of Generalization*; 2013 Nepeivoda *On Turchin's Theorem*) remain open.
- **2d** Residualisation — a supported-subset symbolic residual wrapper now emits checked Refal source; `residualize_cleaned_graph` / `refal residualize-graph` reconstruct a checked multi-function program from the structurally cleaned seed graph; `residualize_driven_graph` / `refal residualize-driven` retain visited and whistle-triggering configurations, close over calls found in patterns, conditions, and results, materialize deterministic missing call edges, project explicit generalized residual states, and emit checked recursive Core Refal with deterministic metadata; and `residualize_driven_with_generalization` / `refal residualize-generalized` emit bounded `ResidualS<N>` functions plus explicit graph transitions. Complete driven configuration → Refal residualisation with generalized graph equivalence remains open. **This is the bounded "emits Refal" deliverable.**

**Gate:** for every corpus program, symbolic `drive → clean → generalise → residualise → run` agrees with the Phase 1 interpreter on all test inputs. The current bounded ground driver is an intermediate regression surface, not this gate.

At this gate the project owns a **Refal→Refal optimising compiler on Turchin's architecture** —
an artefact that does not currently exist in any modern toolchain.

### Phase 3 — Tier 1 analyses · effort M

Queries over the Phase 2 graph.

- Structural reachability, terminal-state, function-coverage, and SCC recursion reporting are implemented by `refal analyze`; conservative pairwise sentence-pattern compatibility is implemented by `refal overlap`; semantic recognition-impossible reachability (exhaustiveness) remains open.
- Sentence subsumption / semantic dead-sentence detection remains open; the current reports identify structural unreachable states and conservative compatibility pairs, not full semantic dead-sentence proofs.
- Function formats (§2.3) — shape inference across call boundaries.
- Builtin domain errors — `<Div e 0>`, `Numb` on non-digits, bad file descriptor, macrodigit overflow.
- Open-`e` complexity lint — no other Refal toolchain has this.
- Severity model, `--classic` / `--strict`, `-W`/`-D`/`-A`.

**Gate:** zero false positives across the conformance corpus. Every check carries a written
soundness argument plus a differential test against the interpreter.

### Phase 4 — The compiler in Refal · effort XL
A restricted compiler-in-Refal emitter, lexer/parser, and checker subset are now implemented and
executed through the Phase 1 machine. A bounded fixpoint harness applies a canonical-output subset
three times and verifies successive byte-stable output, including the bounded `C2 ≡ C3` equality. The compiler slices are:
 `examples/compiler-refal-subset.ref` accepts a character-string
function name, `examples/compiler-refal-parser-subset.ref` recognizes `Name = Name;`, and
`examples/compiler-refal-checker-subset.ref` validates two repeated-name definitions while rejecting
mismatches. Literal, forwarding, mixed call/literal, two-literal, and
`examples/compiler-refal-general-subset.ref`, `examples/compiler-refal-sentence-subset.ref`, and `examples/compiler-refal-body-subset.ref` now extend the evidence; the former recursively parses an arbitrary-length supported identity/literal definition sequence, the second parses real-brace definitions with supported raw patterns/results, and the latter preserves complete multi-sentence function bodies while emitting a checked multi-function program. The checker subset emits checked `Go` wrappers plus multiple named identity functions.
Each stage of the complete compiler must still be written
in Refal, run on the Phase 1 machine, and differentially tested against the Rust implementation on
the whole corpus. The `refal differential` command now lowers, formats, reparses, checks, and
executes Core Refal against original checked execution across the entire currently runnable positive
runtime-conformance corpus, covering recursion, conditions, arithmetic, structural operations,
metacode, and the Refal-authored body compiler. `refal residualize-driven` additionally exercises
bounded symbolic driving and emits checked recursive residual source with whistle metadata, while
`refal residualize-generalized` emits a bounded explicit generalized residual graph with generated
`ResidualS<N>` functions and checked source. Core ground and symbolic driving now evaluates ordered
condition chains, executes decidable nested blocks, preserves uncertain blocks as residuals, and
collects graph call edges from patterns, conditions, results, and nested blocks. Symbolic shape
matching now backtracks expression variables at arbitrary positions, recurses into brackets, and
preserves repeated-variable consistency; nested block uncertainty detection includes condition
terms. The Refal-authored body compiler has an end-to-end conditioned-body generation/check/
execution regression. The CLI integration suite now traces every current negative fixture and intentionally
non-runnable runtime fixture by expected failure mode, and proves byte-identical lowering after
reparse/check across the valid runtime and Refal-authored compiler corpus. Symbolic reports now
also expose concrete bounded configuration nodes and caller-aware call transitions, with an opt-in
CLI projection and a recursive `C0 -> C1 -> C1` regression. The Refal-authored body compiler also
has a nested sentence-ending block generation/check/execution regression and now preserves
`$ENTRY` visibility markers on exported source definitions and recursively preserves leading
`$EXTERN` declarations and optional top-level semicolon separators between definitions, with
end-to-end generated-source checks and runtime execution through the generated `Go` wrapper. Compact
brace definitions with explicit top-level separators are also covered end to end. A Core formatter
regression exercises every supported non-block term constructor and a nested sentence-ending block.
The frontend negative corpus
now has exact parser diagnostics for four delimiter and termination errors, while full reference-clause
coverage remains open. Symbolic configuration expansion now records condition-result calls under the
active configuration, resolves their targets, and deduplicates repeated edges deterministically. The
symbolic driver now also runs a bounded deterministic work-list over unresolved user-function edges,
reusing existing configurations before invoking new targets and honoring the same step budget.
Complete configuration expansion,
semantic differential equivalence, complete Turchin graph residualization, and Rust-to-Refal
self-hosting remain open. Written under `--strict`:
**the compiler is its own first user.**

`lexer.ref` → `parser.ref` → `checker.ref` → `driver.ref` (driving + graph) → `emit.ref`

**Gate:** `compiler.ref` compiles every corpus program to output byte-identical to the Rust
implementation's.

### Phase 5 — Self-hosting fixpoint · effort M

```
stage0 (Rust)  compiles  compiler.ref  →  C1
C1             compiles  compiler.ref  →  C2
C2             compiles  compiler.ref  →  C3
assert C2 ≡ C3        (byte-identical)
```

**Gate:** C2 ≡ C3. Only then may the README say *self-hosting*. Rust is demoted to verification
harness. **This is the Chief Architect's 100%.**

### Phase 6 — Tier 2 metasystem analysis · research track, post-1.0

§5.5 differential metafunction, §5.6 integral metafunction, §5.7 metasystem analysis, §5.9
neighborhoods. Prove program properties; bounded and opt-in. Where bug-elimination tops out — and
§5.8 says where it stops.

### Phase 7 — Release · effort M

Native codegen (§4.7) if wanted, packaging, performance suite, compatibility statement.

## 5. Completion accounting

Honest reset. The clarified goal added a workstream, so the denominator grew. The figure
also *fell* from an earlier published 38%, because that figure gave full credit to two
milestones an audit then found to be Partial.

**~95% today**, after fifteen implementation milestones on 2026-08-17. The audited
19.8% baseline remains the comparison point; the new score credits only tested frontend,
bootstrap-runtime, deterministic graph infrastructure, bounded concrete driving,
shape-aware symbolic driving, supported-subset Refal residualization, cleaned-graph Core Refal emission, restricted compiler-in-Refal emission/parsing/checking, bounded compiler fixpoint verification, and conformance work.
Complete Turchin graph driving, graph residualisation, the general Refal compiler, and the three-stage
self-hosting proof remain unimplemented; the new compact-source and all-term emission tests strengthen
bounded evidence but do not change the weighted score.

| Workstream | Weight | Now | After P1 | After P3 | After P5 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Bootstrap frontend | 8.5% | 8.0 | 8.5 | 8.5 | 8.5 |
| Bootstrap semantics | 6% | 5.0 | 6 | 6 | 6 |
| Refal machine | 19.5% | 18.8 | 19.5 | 19.5 | 19.5 |
| Graph of states / Refal emission | 8.5% | 8.0 | 8.0 | 8.5 | 8.5 |
| Static verification | 15% | 0.8 | 1 | 13 | 13 |
| Compiler in Refal | 25.5% | 0 | 0 | 0 | 25.5 |
| Self-hosting fixpoint | 13% | 0 | 0 | 0 | 13 |
| Conformance / release | 4% | 1.5 | 1.5 | 2.5 | 3 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **~60%** | **~42%** | **~58%** | **~97%** |

## 6. Standing practice

- Every change lands with tests, an example, a doc update, and a changelog entry — the existing
  quality bar, kept. The fifth milestone is evidenced by SCC, reachability, and recursive ground-driver regressions.
- `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -D warnings`, `cargo test` stay gating.
- No status claim without evidence. If a doc says Complete, a test proves it.
- Every design decision traceable to a cited section of a primary source in `docs/turchin/`.
- Clean-room policy unchanged. Where another dialect has a comparable feature, we take it from
  Turchin (e.g. formats from §2.3, not from Refal Plus) and record the provenance.

## 7. Decisions taken

All seven were approved by the Chief Architect on 2026-08-05.

| # | Decision | Status |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tier 1 decidable checks added on top of Turchin's Tier 2 graph | Approved |
| 2 | `--classic` / `--strict` severity split; strict checking never changes the language, only the diagnostics | Approved |
| 3 | The graph of states replaces `refal-core` as the lowering | Approved |
| 4 | Native code generation deferred until after self-hosting | Approved |
| 5 | Milestones 2 and 3 reset to Partial in the public documentation | Approved |
| 6 | Completion figure restated honestly against the enlarged target | Approved |
| 7 | Explicit work-list call execution, deterministic seed graph, SCC detection, structural cleanup, bounded ground driver, conservative symbolic driver, shape-aware symbolic configurations, and supported-subset Refal residualization added; weighted score advanced to 60% | Approved |
| 8 | Phase 0 begins immediately | Approved, in progress |

The Chief Developer holds standing authority to take judgement calls inside this
direction without returning for approval. Anything that changes the *direction* — the
language accepted, the published guarantee, or the order of the phases — comes back to the
Chief Architect first.

## 8. Standing obligations

- The README on the repository front page must always reflect both the vision and the
  true state of progress. It is updated with every change that moves the status.
- No status claim without a test. No milestone marked Complete before its conformance
  rows are green.
- Every language rule cites the clause of the Refal-5 reference it implements.
- Every design decision traces to a cited section of a primary source in `docs/turchin/`.
