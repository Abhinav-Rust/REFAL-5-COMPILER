# Architecture

The compiler is built in stages.

## Design Principles

- **Refal-first semantics:** model object expressions and pattern matching directly.
- **Clean layers:** parsing, checking, lowering, runtime, and backends stay separate.
- **Evidence before claims:** every milestone needs tests and examples.
- **Developer ergonomics:** diagnostics and CLI behavior are part of the compiler, not afterthoughts.
- **Self-hosting path:** bootstrap infrastructure should help the compiler grow beyond the bootstrap.

## Stage A: Bootstrap Front End

The initial implementation uses Rust crates to build a reliable compiler front end:

- `refal-ast`: shared syntax tree data structures.
- `refal-syntax`: lexer and parser.
- `refal`: command-line tool.

This stage gives the project fast tests, precise diagnostics, and a stable foundation.

## Stage B: Semantic Core

Planned crates/modules:

- name resolution,
- declaration checking,
- variable mode validation,
- sentence validation,
- condition validation,
- unsupported-feature diagnostics.

## Stage C: Runtime Semantics

The runtime model will implement:

- object expressions,
- symbols,
- structural brackets,
- `s.`, `t.`, and `e.` variables,
- repeated-variable equality,
- rule selection,
- condition rollback,
- result evaluation,
- built-in functions.

## Stage D: Compiler IR

The front end will lower parsed Refal into an explicit intermediate representation suitable for optimization and code generation.

## Stage E: Backends

The required end goal includes practical output:

- interpreter backend for development,
- Core Refal/source-to-source backend,
- native-code backend for production.

## Stage F: Self-Hosting Track

Once the semantics are stable, the project will grow a Refal-authored compiler path. Rust remains useful as a bootstrap and verification harness, but the long-term compiler identity is Refal-first.
