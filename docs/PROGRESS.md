# Chief Developer — standing orders and live state

**This file is the handoff mechanism.** Any session working on this repository
must read it first and continue immediately. Do not ask whether to continue, do
not wait for a prompt, do not stop at the end of a milestone. Pick up
`NEXT ACTION` below, do it, commit, update this file, repeat.

## Standing orders (from the Chief Architect, Abhinav Sharma)

1. **Commit and push directly to `main`.** No pull requests, no branches, no
   waiting for review. Authorization is standing and explicit.
2. **Work continuously.** Do not pause between milestones. The moment one
   milestone's gate is green, start the next one in the same session.
3. **Update `README.md` at every 5% of honest progress**, and never publish a
   figure that is not backed by a test or a closed gate.
4. **Evidence or it didn't happen.** Every claim lands with a test. A milestone
   is not "complete" because the code looks right.
5. **Be honest about regressions and bugs**, including bugs found in our own
   work. A green suite that encodes a wrong expectation is a bug.

## Definition of done

A Classic Refal-5 compiler **written in Refal**, which **emits Refal**,
**compiles its own sources**, with Turchin's graph-of-states supercompiler and
Tier 1 static verification. Rust survives as bootstrap and verification harness.
Tier 2 metasystem analysis is post-1.0 research and is excluded from the 100%
denominator.

The conformance oracle is **Turchin's own body of work, CS and philosophical
alike** — see [`TURCHIN-OBJECTIVES.md`](TURCHIN-OBJECTIVES.md), which binds each
objective to a gate. Not another Refal implementation.

### Done

- **T-2** no fixed call-depth limit — worklist drives calls and blocks,
  50,000 frames in under a second (`b893b4e`).
- **T-3** projecting matcher, 1980 §2.2 — five anchored `e`-variables over
  60 symbols from >120 s to 1.6 s (`6177793`).
- **T-11** the honest limit is published, §5.8 Theorem 5.1.
- **T-12** control asymmetry respected — `refal differential` proves output
  equivalence; nothing mutates user source.
- Blocks in condition position parse, check, evaluate and round-trip
  (`4112268`).
- Refal-authored lexer (`examples/lexer.ref`) tokenises Classic Refal-5 and
  its own source (`7022fd2`).
- Refal-authored parser (`examples/parser.ref`) builds an AST and parses
  `lexer.ref` (`594ae75`).
- Refal-authored checker in `examples/compiler.ref`, the integrated pipeline
  (`b3588ad`).

### Open

- **T-1** a non-trivial program transformer written in Refal.
- **T-4** complete driving over a graph of states.
- **T-5** full generalization (1980 §4.6, 1988).
- **T-6** clean / perfect graphs.
- **T-7** function formats (§2.3).
- **T-8** metacodes (Ch. 1.3).
- **T-9** a metasystem transition actually occurs — the heart of the claim.
- **T-10** the compiler applied to itself. The current C2 ≡ C3 artifacts are
  source-preserving and **do not close this**.

---

## NEXT ACTION

**Write `emit.ref`: emit Core Refal from the AST, byte-identical to the Rust
bootstrap's `refal lower`.**

Target grammar of `format_program` / `format_sentence` in
`crates/refal-core/src/lib.rs` (read it before starting):

- `$EXTERN a, b;` then a blank line, per declaration.
- `$ENTRY Name {` / `Name {`, sentences indented two spaces, `}`.
  A blank line *between* functions, a single newline after the last.
- Sentence: `pattern` then `, expr : pattern` per condition, then ` =`,
  then ` result` if non-empty, then `;`.
- Terms space-separated. Char quoted with `'` unless it *is* `'`, then `"`.
  Variable as `s.Name` / `t.Name` / `e.Name`. Bracket `( ... )`.
  Call `<Name arg...>`.

Then:

1. Blocks in the parser — sentence endings and conditions.
2. `sX` variable shorthand and `/* */` comments in the lexer.
3. Close **T-10** with a self-hosting slice that genuinely lexes, parses,
   checks and emits — not the source-preserving artifacts we have now.
4. Then **T-9**: make a metasystem transition actually happen.

## Pitfalls already paid for

See the "Traps" section of the session memory, and in summary:

- `(e.Item)` binds a bracket's **contents**; re-emit it wrapped or the tree
  flattens by a level.
- Names are stored as **characters** — write `(Ident 'Go')`, not `(Ident Go)`.
- `(t.V)` is a bracket of exactly **one** term; compare contents instead.
- Bare lowercase `s` / `t` / `e` are rejected by the lexer — use `('s')`.
- `Compare` returns `+` / `0` / `-`. `Chr(Add(Ord('A'), 32))` = `a`.
- Classic Refal-5 has no escape syntax for control characters in **patterns**;
  pass newline in as an argument.
- Files here are CRLF on disk (`core.autocrlf=true`); strip `\r` before lexing.
