# Chief Developer — standing orders and live state

**This file is the handoff mechanism.** Any session working on this repository
must read it first and continue immediately. Do not ask whether to continue, do
not wait for a prompt, do not stop at the end of a milestone. Pick up
`NEXT ACTION` below, do it, commit, update this file, repeat.

## Standing orders (from the Chief Architect, Abhinav Sharma)

1. **Commit and push directly to `main`.** No pull requests, no branches, no
   waiting for review. Authorization is standing and explicit.
2. **Work continuously.** Do not pause between milestones. The moment one
   milestone's gate is green, start the next one in the same session.
3. **Update `README.md` at every 5% of honest progress**, and never publish a
   figure that is not backed by a test or a closed gate.
4. **Evidence or it didn't happen.** Every claim lands with a test. A milestone
   is not "complete" because the code looks right.
5. **Be honest about regressions and bugs**, including bugs found in our own
   work. A green suite that encodes a wrong expectation is a bug.

## Definition of done

A Classic Refal-5 compiler **written in Refal**, which **emits Refal**,
**compiles its own sources**, with Turchin's graph-of-states supercompiler and
Tier 1 static verification. Rust survives as bootstrap and verification harness.
Tier 2 metasystem analysis is post-1.0 research and is excluded from the 100%
denominator.

The conformance oracle is **Turchin's own body of work, CS and philosophical
alike** — see [`TURCHIN-OBJECTIVES.md`](TURCHIN-OBJECTIVES.md), which binds each
objective to a gate. Not another Refal implementation.

### Done

- **T-2** no fixed call-depth limit — worklist drives calls and blocks,
  50,000 frames in under a second (`b893b4e`).
- **T-3** projecting matcher, 1980 §2.2 — five anchored `e`-variables over
  60 symbols from >120 s to 1.6 s (`6177793`).
- **T-11** the honest limit is published, §5.8 Theorem 5.1.
- **T-12** control asymmetry respected — `refal differential` proves output
  equivalence; nothing mutates user source.
- Blocks in condition position parse, check, evaluate and round-trip
  (`4112268`).
- Refal-authored lexer (`examples/lexer.ref`) tokenises Classic Refal-5 and
  its own source (`7022fd2`).
- Refal-authored parser (`examples/parser.ref`) builds an AST and parses
  `lexer.ref` (`594ae75`).
- Refal-authored checker in `examples/compiler.ref`, the integrated pipeline
  (`b3588ad`).
- Refal-authored emitter: `compiler.ref` emits Core Refal byte-identical to the
  Rust bootstrap's `lower` across the **whole corpus** — 47 examples, zero
  divergences — including `sX` shorthand, `/* */` block comments and reals.
- **T-10 closed at full credit**: C1 = C2 = C3 at 12,599 bytes over the full
  Classic grammar, every generation checked.
- **`refal compile`** runs the Refal-authored compiler, not the Rust `lower`.
  The compiler source is compiled into the binary because it *is* the compiler;
  Rust is the bootstrap and the verification harness. Output is re-lexed,
  re-parsed and re-checked before emission, and agrees with `lower` byte for
  byte. `compile` compiles `compiler.ref` itself.
- **Tier 1 delivers the published guarantee**: `--classic` / `--strict`, dead
  sentences, recognition impossible and builtin domain errors, with zero false
  positives across the corpus. All three classes the guarantee names are now
  implemented. `docs/VERIFICATION-CONTRACT.md` is normative.
- **T-7 function formats (§2.3)** inferred to a fixpoint across call boundaries.

### Done — T-9, the metasystem transition

An interpreter is driven over a known object program with an unknown input, and
the residue is the object program translated out of metacode into Refal.

- `examples/metasystem-fuse.ref` — the interpreter disappears entirely. The
  object program `Seq(Lit 'h' (Lit 'i' (End)), In)` drives to
  `e.Input = 'h' 'i' e.Input`. Interpreter calls 4 → 0, steps 56 → 4.
- `examples/metasystem-unroll.ref` — the interpreter's own recursion is
  structural and counter-driven, and driving unwinds it. `Times(3, body)`
  drives to `'a' e.Input 'a' e.Input 'a' e.Input`. Interpreter calls 7 → 0,
  steps 172 → 4.
- `refal metasystem` refuses to claim success unless the residue is checked
  Refal, agrees with the interpreter on every input tried, and is measurably
  cheaper. The transition is established by observation, not assertion.

Two bugs had to be fixed to get here, both found by making the attempt:

- The driving matchers disagreed with the runtime matcher on Refal-5 variable
  kinds (reference 1.3). `s.` accepted only characters, so `('c' s.N)` never
  matched `('c' 1)` and driving stalled at the first constant in a metacoded
  program; `t.` accepted only brackets. `examples/metacode-macrodigit.ref` is
  the regression fixture. The runtime matcher was the oracle and was right.
- Driving could not tell a cycle from a repeat. A configuration recurring *on
  the path being expanded* is a cycle and must be folded; the same
  configuration recurring *after completing* is separate work with the same
  answer and must be reused. Conflating them whistled at the second turn of
  every ground-bounded loop and left the loop residual.

A third came out of the same work: `residualize_symbolic` could emit
`<Go e.Input>` for the entry, a program that cannot terminate. It now falls
back to the source program when driving learns nothing — a supercompiler that
cannot specialise must at least preserve what it was given.

### Open

- **Exhaustiveness where the format lattice is too coarse**, and `-W`/`-D`/`-A`
  per-lint control.
- **T-1** a non-trivial program transformer written in Refal. The compiler
  slices are a start; a transformer that is not itself a compiler is the
  remaining case.
- **T-4** complete Turchin configuration driving (§4.2): the driver still works
  over source-preserved sentence states rather than a true configuration graph.
- **T-5** the complete generalization algorithm (1988). The whistle and a
  sound, least-general LGG exist; the iterated "is this too general" check does
  not.
- **T-6** clean / perfect graphs (§4.3, §4.5).
- **T-8** metacodes (Ch. 1.3). `Dn`/`Up` cover a tagged subset; the Chapter 6
  contract is open.
- Heap-allocated single view field (issue #7); `driver.ref`.

## NEXT ACTION

**T-4: complete Turchin configuration driving (§4.2), then T-5 generalization.**

T-9 is closed, but it is closed on a driver that works over source-preserved
sentence states rather than a true graph of configurations. That is enough to
demonstrate the transition; it is not yet Turchin's machine, and it is why the
cases that drive cleanly today are the ones where the object program is known
and only the input is symbolic.

Order:

1. Replace sentence states with real configurations — a call and its argument,
   not a source sentence — so that two calls to the same sentence with
   different arguments are different nodes. Today they are the same node, which
   is what forced the fold/reuse distinction to be discovered the hard way.
2. Generalize off that graph (T-5, 1980 §4.6 and the 1988 algorithm) instead of
   off the bounded LGG, so a loop with an *unknown* counter residualizes into a
   terminating specialized function rather than stalling.
3. Clean the result (T-6, §4.3) and residualize the whole graph, not the
   reachable slice.

Then the remaining Tier 1 precision work — exhaustiveness where the format
lattice is too coarse, and `-W`/`-D`/`-A` per-lint control.

The soundness gate is unchanged and non-negotiable:
`strict_mode_has_no_false_positives_on_the_corpus` must stay green. If a new
check rejects an example the repository believes is sound, the check is wrong,
not the example — unless it has found a real bug, as the dead-sentence check did.

## Machine load

This is developed on an HP laptop running Windows 11 Pro. Keep the load
balanced: build and test with `-j 2`, prefer a targeted
`cargo test -p <crate> <filter>` over a full workspace run, and leave a pause
between heavy commands rather than chaining them back to back.
