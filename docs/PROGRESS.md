# Chief Developer — standing orders and live state

**This file is the handoff mechanism.** Any session working on this repository
must read it first and continue immediately. Do not ask whether to continue, do
not wait for a prompt, do not stop at the end of a milestone. Pick up
`NEXT ACTION` below, do it, commit, update this file, repeat.

## Standing orders (from the Chief Architect, Abhinav Sharma)

1. **Commit and push directly to `main`.** No pull requests, no branches, no
   waiting for review. Authorization is standing and explicit.
2. **Work continuously.** Do not pause between milestones. The moment one
   milestone's gate is green, start the next one in the same session.
3. **Update `README.md` at every 5% of honest progress**, and never publish a
   figure that is not backed by a test or a closed gate.
4. **Evidence or it didn't happen.** Every claim lands with a test. A milestone
   is not "complete" because the code looks right.
5. **Be honest about regressions and bugs**, including bugs found in our own
   work. A green suite that encodes a wrong expectation is a bug.

## Definition of done

A Classic Refal-5 compiler **written in Refal**, which **emits Refal**,
**compiles its own sources**, with Turchin's graph-of-states supercompiler and
Tier 1 static verification. Rust survives as bootstrap and verification harness.
Tier 2 metasystem analysis is post-1.0 research and is excluded from the 100%
denominator.

The conformance oracle is **Turchin's own body of work, CS and philosophical
alike** — see [`TURCHIN-OBJECTIVES.md`](TURCHIN-OBJECTIVES.md), which binds each
objective to a gate. Not another Refal implementation.

### Done

- **T-2** no fixed call-depth limit — worklist drives calls and blocks,
  50,000 frames in under a second (`b893b4e`).
- **T-3** projecting matcher, 1980 §2.2 — five anchored `e`-variables over
  60 symbols from >120 s to 1.6 s (`6177793`).
- **T-11** the honest limit is published, §5.8 Theorem 5.1.
- **T-12** control asymmetry respected — `refal differential` proves output
  equivalence; nothing mutates user source.
- Blocks in condition position parse, check, evaluate and round-trip
  (`4112268`).
- Refal-authored lexer (`examples/lexer.ref`) tokenises Classic Refal-5 and
  its own source (`7022fd2`).
- Refal-authored parser (`examples/parser.ref`) builds an AST and parses
  `lexer.ref` (`594ae75`).
- Refal-authored checker in `examples/compiler.ref`, the integrated pipeline
  (`b3588ad`).
- Refal-authored emitter: `compiler.ref` emits Core Refal byte-identical to the
  Rust bootstrap's `lower` across the **whole corpus** — 47 examples, zero
  divergences — including `sX` shorthand, `/* */` block comments and reals.
- **T-10 closed at full credit**: C1 = C2 = C3 at 12,599 bytes over the full
  Classic grammar, every generation checked.
- **`refal compile`** runs the Refal-authored compiler, not the Rust `lower`.
  The compiler source is compiled into the binary because it *is* the compiler;
  Rust is the bootstrap and the verification harness. Output is re-lexed,
  re-parsed and re-checked before emission, and agrees with `lower` byte for
  byte. `compile` compiles `compiler.ref` itself.
- **Tier 1 delivers the published guarantee**: `--classic` / `--strict`, dead
  sentences, recognition impossible and builtin domain errors, with zero false
  positives across the corpus. All three classes the guarantee names are now
  implemented. `docs/VERIFICATION-CONTRACT.md` is normative.

### Open

- **Exhaustiveness for non-literal arguments**, which needs function formats.
- **T-1** a non-trivial program transformer written in Refal.
- **T-4** complete driving over a graph of states.
- **T-5** full generalization (1980 §4.6, 1988).
- **T-6** clean / perfect graphs.
- **T-7** function formats (§2.3).
- **T-8** metacodes (Ch. 1.3).
- **T-9** a metasystem transition actually occurs — the heart of the claim.

## NEXT ACTION

**T-9: make a metasystem transition actually happen.**

This is the heart of Turchin's claim and the largest remaining piece. An
interpreter is driven over a program and the result is a *specialised residual
program* — the metasystem transition from §5.5. Everything built so far is the
apparatus around that moment; the moment itself has not been demonstrated.

Order:

1. Drive a Refal interpreter over a concrete program with a partially known
   argument, using the existing graph machinery in `refal-core`.
2. Fold repeated configurations; the homeomorphic-embedding whistle is already
   there, so the work is generalization and residualization of what driving
   produces.
3. Prove the transition by *observing* it: the residual program must be smaller
   or faster than the original, and `refal differential` must show the two agree.

Tier 1 is finished as far as the published guarantee goes — all three classes it
names are implemented. What remains there is precision, not coverage: widening
`Shape` so format-disjointness catches more, and `-W`/`-D`/`-A` per-lint control.

The soundness gate is unchanged and non-negotiable:
`strict_mode_has_no_false_positives_on_the_corpus` must stay green. If a new
check rejects an example the repository believes is sound, the check is wrong,
not the example — unless it has found a real bug, as the dead-sentence check did.

## Machine load

This is developed on an HP laptop running Windows 11 Pro. Keep the load
balanced: build and test with `-j 2`, prefer a targeted
`cargo test -p <crate> <filter>` over a full workspace run, and leave a pause
between heavy commands rather than chaining them back to back.
